Technical challenges

Implementing the cart function, and connecting the cart function to the order function, was the most challenging thing for me. 
When users want to put items in their cart, I get the order list by user Id and check the order list whether it has a pending order or not. 
If there is a pending order, I get the order and get the cart in the order, and put the items in the cart. 
If there is no pending order in the order list, I make a new order and set the status as pending. 
In the new pending order, I make a new cart and put items in the cart and save the cart in the order. That is what I did for implementing the cart and order function. 

I wanted to implement that different role has different authorities. 
To do that I used spring security and made two different roles. One is a customer, and another one is an admin. 
Admin user has more authority than customer user. Only admin users can edit the item, product, user list and see the admin section.
